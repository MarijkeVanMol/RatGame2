        I soon realized that ‚Äòthe world feels too busy‚Äô because there is an
        overwhelming amount of stimuli. <br /><br />
        First, I explored external stimuli and made plans for a ‚Äòstimuli slider‚Äô
        in which one could adjust their own environment‚Äôs stimuli. <br /><br />I
        started with recreating my own ‚Äòoffice‚Äô/the showable and work-part of my
        bedroom in Blender. After constructing this, I started to manipulate the
        objects within. My idea of overstimulation, stimulation and
        under-stimulation can be seen below.

        You have arrived at the second part of my process. <br />
        In this part, I realized that I was looking in the wrong direction. I
        wanted to find ‚Äòinner peace‚Äô, but was looking at external stimuli.
        <br />I researched breathing techniques (like deep breathing) and read
        ‚ÄòFrazzled‚Äô by Ruby Wax. Mindfulness is a tool which allows one‚Äôs mind to
        be more conscious and grounded, which in turn helps a stressed mind to
        recognize the signs before it goes all godzilla. <br />
        The connection between the mind and body is very important, for they
        influence each other. Breathing is one way to connect both. If you are
        stressed you might forget to inhale or do it very quickly. Breathe
        slowly and the body relaxes. And guess what‚Äôs key in mindfulness?
        Breathing. <br />
        Also, not letting your thoughts stray. Meditation is a practice is
        staying calm and present. Especially being present, is something the
        teaclub in my head doesn‚Äôt like very much.

      <p class="g-text-one">
        I decided I wanted to make a game. Just like the earlier experiments, it
        would play with over- and under-stimulation. However, I wasn‚Äôt sure of
        the shape. Thus, this ‚Äòpart‚Äô starts with a small experiment, combining
        ‚Äòtasks‚Äô of a game with overstimulation and under-stimulation. Here, the
        thought was doing less means less overstimulation, and this thought
        inspired the later ‚Äòthe only way to win is not to play‚Äô. In an
        in-between moment, that I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, but was playing with
        the concept of ‚Äòracing‚Äô, the words ‚Äòrat race‚Äô fell during one of the
        discussions with my teachers. This immediately put a name on my game and
        a clearer goal to üòâ chase. From that point on, everything moved pretty
        fast. I got my first screen board (above) down. Excuse my drawing
        skills.

        Whilst looking for visual inspiration, I stumbled upon this undoubtedly
        very overstimulating rat cage. This set the tone for the game. I made a
        color scheme and started on my first designs for the rat and
        subsequently the cheese it would chase. I tore away from the visual race
        court and cars I had in mind and started working more towards a ‚Äòcage-y‚Äô
        vibe. That really fitted with my idea of the Rat Race anyway. I can be
        like: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just going to work six hours today, because research proved
        it was good‚Äô; but still feel like I should be working eight hours or
        even more. Peer pressure and ‚Äòexpected ways of work-life balance‚Äô do
        influence one quite a bit, even if you don‚Äôt want to.

        I decided to fully concentrate on the Rat Race (whereas before I wanted
        to incorporate also the relaxing aspect of stimuli). Both
        overstimulation and under-stimulation play a part and define two kinds
        of levels within the game. One has an overload of visuals and sound,
        whereas the other is painstakingly slow and lacks in visual variety. A
        Race Race is chasing a basically impossible goal. This is also the case
        for the game. In the beginning, the player sees that catching cheese
        equals winning. But the amount? I guess you‚Äôll have to sacrifice your
        ears, eyes, hands and time to find out. I coded this game with
        Phaser.js, an engine browser?, and a lot of Coding: the coding part,
        behavior Visuals: layers,
