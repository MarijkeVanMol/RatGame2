      I soon realized that ‘the world feels too busy’ because<br />there is an
      overwhelming amount of stimuli. <br />
      First, I explored external stimuli and made plans for a ‘stimuli slider’
      in which one could adjust their own environment’s stimuli. <br />I
      started with recreating my own ‘office’/the showable and work-part of my
      bedroom in Blender. <br />After constructing this, I start to manipulate
      several aspects within this ‘space’. The GIFs you see below are the
      first experiments in my search for what overstimulation and
      under-stimulation looks like.

      Internal stimuli can be divided into four categories: ideas, tasks,
      emotions, physical stimuli
    </p>
    <p class="in-text">
      Around December, I realized that I had mainly been focusing on external stimuli. At that point, I was reading
      several books. One was Mark Tigchelaar and Oscar de Bos’ Focus On/Off. He underlined that often we blame external
      stimuli as our main ‘distractors’, while usually it’s internal stimuli that go running with our attention. At
      least, that was the case for me. Above you can see a small demonstration of thoughts ‘popping up’ in your head.
      </br>
      Another book I read was Ruby Wax’ Frazzled. This author explores the brain and the (positive) influence
      mindfulness can have on your brain and concentration. Many mindfulness or meditation practices have breathing
      exercises. This is because it connects the mind and the body. You learn to concentrate on the presence, on your
      body essentially. </br>
      Why am I writing all of this? Because this part of my research influences the first stadia of my game (see the <a
        href="@storyboard">storyboard</a>, <a href="#theGame">The Game</a>). In these stadia, I wanted to combine both
      internal and external stimuli. This game would first overwhelm the player, then under-stimulate the player and
      then guide them to a ‘healthy state of stimuli’. Similarly, it would first distract the player, then leave the
      player wanting to be distracted and help them focus on themselves and the present.

      I was inspired by the game Playne. In this mindfulness game, the player meets a companion in the shape of a fox
      and this animal helps the player find new ways to approach healthy living. Another game that greatly inspired me
      was The Stanley Parable in which the aspect of ‘winning’ is questioned. It also confuses the heck out of the
      player. </br>All things I wanted to include in my game.

      Whilst looking for visual inspiration, I stumbled upon this undoubtedly
      very overstimulating rat cage. This set the tone for the game. I made a
      color scheme and started on my first designs for the rat and
      subsequently the cheese it would chase. I tore away from the race
      court and cars I had in mind and started working more towards a ‘cage-y’
      vibe. </br>The aspect of ‘climbing up’ in a cage or set canvas also felt very rat-race-like.</br>
      Teachers and classmates told me about the Black Mirror episode Nosedive. In Nosedive, something very interesting
      happens sound-wise. A sound that was once rewarding, was shaped into a song that played in the background of while
      the main character had her biggest downfall. A positive sound became negative. I decided to play with this as
      well, when I was designing my own ‘soundtrack’ for the game.

      I watched the movie Koyaanisqati. The title is a word from the Hopi language and means, among other things, ‘crazy
      life’, ‘a state of life that calls for another way of living’. The busy colors and distressing soundtrack greatly
      inspired my collages and their bright colors and soundtrack </br>
      Just like Koyaanisqati, calls the rat race and my game for ‘another way of living’ or gaming. When you are stuck
      in an actual rat race or in my game, usually all you see is the end goal, even though it is (often) unachievable.
      I consider quitting this lifestyle — and consequently the game — 'really winning', because in a sense you
      ‘escaped’ this exhausting and repetitive life. </br>
      Players know what to expect in games because of game tropes. My goal for this game is making the player suffer and
      experience one hell of a game/rat race. Thus, I decided to take many of these game tropes out and do the exact
      opposite. </br>
      Throughout my year, I did research on stimuli and how it (negatively) affects us. I use only two states of
      stimulation: over- and understimulation. These states are often experienced negatively. </br> </br>
      All this is explained in detail in the video below, </br>where I go through the game and its design.
